Face Detection using Viola-Jones Algorithm

# Plan of Attack:

* Viola-Jones algorithm
* Haar-Like features
* Training Classifiers
* Adaptive Boosting (Adaboost)
* Cascading

Viola-Jones algorithm: Developed in 2001 (Still a Powerful one) <br />
It consists of Training and Detection.<br />
It works on the Grey-Scale but the results are pretty good.<br />
